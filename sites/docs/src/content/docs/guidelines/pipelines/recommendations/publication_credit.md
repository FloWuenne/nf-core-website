Pipeline publications (or papers within which pipelines are described for the first time) should acknowledge the nf-core community (e.g. in an academic journal). Please cite the following publication, which describes the community and framework in detail:

> Ewels, P.A., Peltzer, A., Fillinger, S. et al. The nf-core framework for community-curated bioinformatics pipelines. Nat Biotechnol 38, 276–278 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-020-0439-x

**At a minimum**, the nf-core community should be thanked in the acknowledgment section. A good example is from the [nf-core/clipseq](https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.19453.1)) preprint:

> We would also like to thank the nf-core team, in particular Harshil Patel, Phil Ewels and Maxime Garcia, for welcoming us to the nf-core community and their assistance in reviewing and releasing the pipeline. We would also like to thank the nf-core community for developing the nf-core infrastructure and resources for Nextflow pipelines. A full list of nf-core community members is available at https://nf-co.re/community.

For more examples, see the acknowledgments section of publications like: ([nf-core/eager](https://peerj.com/articles/10947/#acknowledgements)).

List of Publications about nf-core and nf-core pipelines can be found [here](https://nf-co.re/publications).

**Optionally**, the nf-core community can be included as a consortium co-author of the publication ([example](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms232314512)). This route is a good idea when a pipeline has used extensive existing nf-core pipeline infrastructure (e.g. modules) that were written by other members of the community not directly involved in the pipeline itself.

If any members of the nf-core community have provided significant input to the creation of the pipeline, please consider adding them as coauthors on the paper directly.

If you’re unsure how to acknowledge **nf-core** in your publication, feel free to ping the `@core-team` on slack for advice.
