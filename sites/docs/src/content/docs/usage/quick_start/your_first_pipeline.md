## Your first pipeline

Nextflow works best with an active internet connection, as it is able to fetch all pipeline requirements. Running Nextflow without an active internet connection requires extra steps to move tooling, pipelines, and other assets offline. See [Running offline](/docs/usage/configuration/runningoffline) for more information.

### Hello world!

Run Nextflowâ€™s example [Hello world!](https://github.com/nextflow-io/hello) pipeline to confirm Nextflow is installed and that you have an active internet connection:

```bash
nextflow run hello
```

If everything has been installed properly you should see the pipeline launch and run to completion.

Congratulations! You have just run your first Nextflow pipeline!

### nf-core pipelines

Each nf-core pipeline will have different run requirements.

It is best to test it is working using a small dataset that is known to work before running a pipeline with your own data.

nf-core pipelines come packed with a `test` profile that uses small files from the [nf-core/test-datasets](https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets) repository. The `test` profile is extensively tested and should run without extra configuration. nf-core pipelines come packed with directives for containers and environments that can be flexibly enabled using software dependency profiles (e.g., `docker`, `singularity`, and `conda`). By using a profile for software dependencies an nf-core pipeline should run with all required tools.

Run the `nf-core/rnaseq` pipeline using the `test` profile and a software dependencies profile (e.g., `docker`) to confirm Nextflow is installed and that you have an active internet connection:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -profile test,docker --outdir results
```

If everything has been installed properly you should see the pipeline launch and run to completion.

Congratulations! You have just run your first nf-core pipeline! You are now ready to start adding your own data and configure the pipeline to better suit your requirements.
