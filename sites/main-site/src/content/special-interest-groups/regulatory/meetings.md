# Meeting schedule

The Regulatory special interest group is going to Kick off on July 1st, 2024 at 4PM (CEST) - see the [event page](/events/2024/SIG_regulatory_kickoff) for more details.

After the kick off, we will have regular monthly meetups with a to-be-defined schedule that will be posted here, on LinkedIn and in the `#regulatory` Slack channel. We will also have invited speakers on topics in the regulatory space, so stay tuned for updates on these channels!
