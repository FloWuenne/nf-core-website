As decided during the last maintainers meeting, the whole week was dedicated to spring cleaning.
We would first like to thank everyone that was involved and help clean any of the nf-core github repository by closing issues, updating, merging or closing PRs.
It was a tremendous effort, and thanks to all of you, the nf-core/hackathon should be facilitated by being able to start with repositories less crowded by issues.

## Overview

We were dedicated in a multitude of groups that were focused on particular tasks:

- nf-core/pipelines
- nf-core/modules
- nf-core/documentation
- nf-core/configs
- nf-core/test-dataset
- Hackathon preparation
- Core Team

### Pipelines:

- Stats
  - 50 pipelines out of 116 were checked out
  - 5 DSL1
  - 8 not maintained
  - 2/3 will not continue to be maintained
  - Majority of pipelines was all good
  - Couple of problems and issues were found, so issues were created for this
  - James pestered every proposal that was not started
  - Maxime will archive pipelines that needs archiving in a couple of weeks
- Discussions
    - ⚒️ Need more people on pipelines team next time (quite large, domain-specific knowledge would help speed up) or 1 extra week
    - ⚒️ We should push people to develop on nf-core
    - A yearly check should be enough
    - ⚒️ Last update of the dev branch should be featured on the pipeline health page

### Modules:

- Stats
  - PRs:
    - Bumped PRs: 51
    - Closed PRs: 62
    - Needs help: 10
    - Stay open: 19
    - In progress: 25
  - Issues:
    - To do: 192
    - Bumped: 66
    - Closed: 72
    - In Progress: 49
    - Suggestion: 26
- Discussions
  - Famke and Luisa are MVP (53 PRs reviewed by Famke, 108/106 Issues)
  - Luisa DMed Maxime because he never check GitHub
  - Everything tagged
  - ⚒️ Prepare some boilerplate messages for posting on issues/PRs/channels
    - We could have pre-saved messages even -> DUMP 2025 MESSAGES HERE: https://hackmd.io/OE_WueP2SD6XCeALyH-VUw
  - Is 'new issue' thing really necessary
    - Lots of 'junk' / abandoned
    - Used as a wishlist
  - ⚒️ We should automate tagging things prior spring cleaning?
    - Be smarter with automatic replies / tags / types(!?)
    -  Replace tags with types
    - Auto add stuff to hackathon boards?
  - Let's continue yearly
  - Additional stuff from Simon
    -  Standardise metadata tags formatting
    - Clean up old subworkflows to match current guidelines
    - Flag modules with custom meta fields
    - params usage

### Configs:

  - Stats
    - 11 Done
    - 16 In progress
  - Discussion
    - Mostly Edmund
    - ⚒️ Quite a few issues/PRs set up but the abandoned - this repo is not something we can test/someone can come and return - Stalebot
    - ⚒️ Can we add a tag so stalebot ignore stuff that should not be closed?
      - ⚒️ Tools will only have stalebot work if 'waiting feedback' tag

- Discussion:
    - Regular cleanup is done more or less regularly by James and Maxime
    - So there was less of an effort

### Test-datasets

  - No major activity (requires a bigger overhaul)
  - James/Maxime wants to REDO it all

### Hackathon preparation

- Ongoing - pestering people to add tasks to project board (300-400 issues)

### Core team

- Stats
  - Slack team update: no update
  - Github groups: updated
  - Core team checklist: updated
  - Slack channels: most public investigated, 3 closed, 1 renamed, a few assigned to others
  - Pipeline proposals: 100 checkeed, 37 proposals timed out, 16 flagged for archiving
  - All accepted special interest groups now have websites (immunology, core facilities, other)
  - Pipeline archiving: will do soon now has list from pipeline time/core
  - AWS cleaning: checked all pipeliens have megatests, cleaning up CEs, cleaning up AWS account (will continue longer - needs core team discussion)
  - Non-pipeline repos:
- Discussion
  - Can we link github team with slack teams to reduce manual
  - >200 proposals (of all status), but hard to search
    - ⚒️ Add keywords to proposals?
    - ⚒️ Move from slack board to a github repository
  -  Lots of suggestions from Maxime
      - ⚒️ https://github.com/nf-core/.github
          - Should we add a member page?
          - My guess is that all is covered or should be by website
      -⚒️  https://github.com/nf-core/basic_training :white_check_mark:
          - Leave as is for now, we will see with Nextflow training team how to migrate and unify content

          - To pipeline?
      - https://github.com/nf-core/vale :question:

### tools

- Stats
  - deleted 34/55 branches (55->21)
  - closed 8 PRs
  - closed 29 issues (3 from 2020 2 from 2021!)
- Discussion
  - ⚒️ Should we auto-delete merged branches everywhere?


### General

- Modules: Simon very pro adding 'waiting feedback' stale bot system like in tools
- Modules: module requests should NOT be on modules, but should be on a pipeline - and linked back somewhere
  - For wishlist modules -> a single issue with a list of requests, rather than one issue per
  - Maybe auto close after 6 months if you don't plan to work on it?
