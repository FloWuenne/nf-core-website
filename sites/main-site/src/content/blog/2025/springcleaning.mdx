As decided during the last maintainers meeting, the whole week was dedicated to spring cleaning.
We would first like to thank everyone that was involved and help clean any of the nf-core github repository by closing issues, updating, merging or closing PRs.
It was a tremendous effort, and thanks to all of you, the nf-core/hackathon should be facilitated by being able to start with repositories less crowded by issues.

## Overview

We were dedicated in a multitude of groups that were focused on particular tasks:

- nf-core/pipelines
- nf-core/modules
- nf-core/documentation
- nf-core/configs
- nf-core/test-dataset
- Hackathon preparation
- Core Team

### Pipelines:

Half of the nf-core pipelines were assessed, most of them were in good shape.
Around 10 of them are not maintained and will need further assessment from the core team about their status.
Such a yearly check seemed to be enough, and we do hope to have either more time or more people to work on this task next year.

### Modules:

An astounding number of issues and PRs were reviewed and closed.
Famke and Luisa were the MVP.
Using more automation would really help cleaning up all the issues and PRs, as well as using the new `types` from GitHub.
Such a yearly check seemed to be enough, but will definitively benefit from more automation.

### Configs:

Regular cleanup is done more or less regularly by James and Maxime, and this repo is smaller, so this was less of an effort

### Test-datasets

No major activity, as this requires a bigger overhaul.

### Hackathon preparation

Still an ongoing project, we will continue asking people to add tasks to project board.

### Core team

Megatests have been investigated, and all CEs have been cleared on the nf-core Platform workspace.
The new pipelines procedure has been assessed, and the core team will be investigating another solution to allow for better search, retrieval and tracking of all the proposals.

### tools

29 issues and 8 PRs were closed.
34 branches were deleted, so we're thinking about enabling auto-delete merged branches everywhere.

### General

Simon, our very own modules master, is very pro adding 'waiting feedback' stale bot system like in tools.
We're thinking of a better way to managed requests for new modules (the whishlist should be on the pipeline side).
